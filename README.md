Financial Analysis of Big Rock Candy Mountain Mining Co. Using Excel
This project involved conducting a comprehensive financial analysis of Big Rock Candy Mountain Mining Co. using Excel. Key deliverables included creating the company's balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, followed by calculating financial ratios and automating their analysis using IF statements. Additionally, the Altman’s Z-Score model was applied to assess financial distress, with results indicating no signs of distress.

## Key Findings:

### Areas of Potential Concern:
1. Inventory Turnover (6.08x in 2016) is below the industry standard (7.00x), indicating slower inventory movement.
2. Fixed Asset Turnover (1.19x in 2016) lags significantly behind the industry standard (11.20x), suggesting inefficient asset utilization.
3. Return on Assets (ROA) (3.92% in 2016) is considerably lower than the industry benchmark (9.10%), reflecting suboptimal asset profitability.

### Areas of Improvement:
1. Debt Management: The Total Debt Ratio improved from 48.17% in 2015 to 46.02% in 2016, aligning well with the industry standard (50.00%).
2. Profitability: The Gross Profit Margin increased from 20.40% in 2015 to 22.72% in 2016, surpassing the industry average (17.50%), showcasing better cost efficiency.
3. Interest Coverage: The Time Interest Earned ratio rose from 3.06x in 2015 to 4.25x in 2016, far exceeding the industry standard (2.50x), indicating improved financial stability.

## Conclusion:
The financial analysis revealed a stable financial position with notable improvements in profitability and debt management. However, areas like inventory turnover, asset utilization, and ROA require attention to align with industry standards. The use of Altman’s Z-Score confirmed no immediate financial distress, highlighting the company's overall sound financial health.
